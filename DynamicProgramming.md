1. Overlapping subproblem : Solution for subproblems needed again and again
2. Optimal substructure : Optimal solution to subproblems can be used to achieved Optimal solution to a problem
3. Mostly an optimization problem ( find best/ shortest/ most efficient) 


### Kind of problems
1. Decision Making
2. Distinct Ways
3. Max/Min
4. Merging Intervals
5. String problems
